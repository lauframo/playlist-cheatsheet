# About

As one of the radio hosts at my college radio station, I prepped for my show by creating a playlist of my sets and researching each track and artist. This resulted in a million tabs and endless Google searches. 

Now that I'm out, I still find my self going down Wikipedia k-holes when discovering new music- I hope to make this a little bit easier by leveraging the Spotify and LastFM apps to create a simple app that will let any Spotify account owner get acquainted with their music in a matter of minutes.
